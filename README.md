CarKeeper AI: Vehicle Maintenance Tracker

A full-stack application developed to help vehicle owners manage service records and track maintenance history. This project demonstrates proficiency in Full-Stack Architecture, SQL Database Design, and AI API Integration.

🚀 Key Features

AI Receipt Processing: Integration with the Google Gemini API to automatically extract service dates, costs, and tasks from uploaded maintenance receipts.

Relational Data Management: A robust backend system to handle multi-user accounts, vehicle profiles, and service logs.

Dynamic Dashboard: A responsive React interface featuring real-time maintenance summaries and cost tracking.

🛠 Technical Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (Responsive UI/UX design)

Backend: Python Flask (RESTful API Development)

Database: SQL (SQLite) with custom schema migration logic

Deployment: Successfully deployed using Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend)

📁 Project Structure

/frontend: React source code, including state management for maintenance records and vehicle data.

/backend: Flask API routes, SQLite database initialization, and logic for AI-powered OCR extraction.

⚙️ Technical Highlights

Data Integrity: Implemented backend validation (safe_int, safe_float) to ensure data accuracy across the SQLite database.

RESTful Design: Developed a clean API architecture supporting full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for vehicles and maintenance logs.

Scalability: Built with a modular approach, allowing for easy expansion of features like mileage reminders or multi-vehicle comparison.

This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of technical development skills and full-stack integration.
